## üöÄ Quick start
1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    npm i
    npm start
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the important top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

2.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/).

3.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. Many different plug-ins configurations and settings can be found here.

4.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. This is the place where all GraphQL/Rest queries are done, before filled in the interernal GraphQL storage.

5. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt be changing this file directly).**

6. **`.babelrc`**: Babel additional settings, presets and plug-ins.

7. **`.env.development / .env.production`**: Development / production enviroment settings for API, SDKs and plug-ins.

8. **`.eslintrc.js`**: Custom eslint rules for common code style.

9. **`buildspec.yml / cf-template.yml`**: Related files to the deployment on AWS Codebuild / S3.

10. **`mobx-provider.js`**: Inserts mobx provider to all pages and access to the stores.

11. **`buildspec.yml / cf-template.yml`**:

## üéì Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
